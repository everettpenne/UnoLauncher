# Changelog

## 0.16.9-uno01

- Fix the dynamic island's position: it now wraps the front-camera hole (centered on it, symmetric around it, with the time on one side and charging/battery on the other and the expanded panel hanging below it) instead of drifting to the right. The old placement centered the island inside a safe-area-padded parent and then added the cutout's window offset on top, and also read pixel values as dp. Layout is now pure geometry in window pixels (`IslandGeometry`), re-read from the live window insets on every layout so it follows rotation and folding, and an off-center or edge-flush hole (such as the Pixel Fold's inner camera) is still fully wrapped.

## 0.16.8-uno01

- Dynamic island: a liquid-glass capsule anchored to the camera cutout on Home. Collapsed it shows the time (and charging); tap it to expand into a live panel with time, battery, the top feed headline, and search/feed/customize actions; it auto-collapses after five seconds.
- App launches and charging transitions flash through the island.
- The island is launcher-local and never overlays other apps; a Dynamic island switch lives under Wallpaper & appearance.

## 0.16.7-uno01

- Liquid controls: sliders and switches in customization are glass when liquid glass is on — an orange iOS slider with a refracting glass thumb and a green iOS switch with a glass thumb, with the stock Material fallback when glass is off.
- Three lens knobs replace the single refraction slider: refraction height, refraction amount, and chromatic aberration, each 0-100% and persisted separately (the old single value migrates).
- iOS accents: green switches, orange slider tracks and value labels.

## 0.16.6-uno01

- Target Pixel phones on GrapheneOS, with the Pixel Fold (2023) as the primary design device; documentation no longer names a Samsung reference device.
- The leading page always exists. It shows Google Discover only where the Google app is installed and Window Extensions exist; otherwise (and whenever a configured feed is preferred) it is the news feed. With no feed configured it is an opt-in page offering the GrapheneOS announcements and release feeds, and nothing is contacted until one is tapped.
- Network hardening: feeds must be https, redirects are followed only within the same host (at most three), and an explicit network-security config refuses cleartext. The GrapheneOS forum publishes no RSS/Atom feed, so suggestions use `grapheneos.social` and `grapheneos.org`.
- Feed reader: untitled posts (Mastodon) get a headline from their text, HTML is stripped from summaries, and Atom `xhtml` content is read instead of dropped.
- Shade gestures are now a one-time, easily declined opt-in: the prompt explains what the accessibility service can and can't do, **No thanks** is remembered, and a declined swipe is silent. Help & setup still offers it.
- iOS-style corners: one four-step corner scale (12/18/24/32 dp plus capsule) used everywhere, app icons use Apple's 22.37% continuous-corner silhouette with an antialiased mask, and settings switches use iOS colors. Panels keep circular-arc corners because the glass lens accepts only rounded rectangles.
- Fix unreadable dark text on the glass feed page.

## 0.16.5-uno01

- Fix backdrop sampling: the wallpaper and pager now record into separate layers that glass surfaces combine, so the dock and rail refract real page content instead of empty pixels.
- Run Home beneath the dock and status rail, iOS-style: pages slide under the glass during swipes while Discover and All apps stay clipped to the viewport.
- Glass for everything inside the pager: feed, Discover recovery, All apps, the widget gallery, the first-run and app/empty-space sheets (inset glass cards), the page-dot capsule, and the search/back circle controls.
- Refraction slider now spans 0-200% with a stronger lens curve and chromatic aberration from 50%.

## 0.16.4-uno01

- Real liquid refraction: the lens effect now uses deeper displacement with depth weighting, and adds chromatic aberration at high intensities.
- Add a refraction intensity slider under Wallpaper & appearance; the default sits at 55% and the top end matches the demo's heavy bending.

## 0.16.3-uno01

- Extend liquid glass: the status rail and folder panel are now glass surfaces.
- Springy press glows and scale on dock, Home, and folder icons.
- Glass tint follows the wallpaper: the committed photo's muted palette color blends into the theme glass (drawn dunes keep the theme tint).

## 0.16.2-uno01

- Experiment: liquid glass aesthetics. The dock, customization panel, and feed page now blur and refract Home behind them (vibrancy, blur, and lens effects).
- Add a Liquid glass switch under Wallpaper & appearance; turning it off restores the flat glass look and saves battery.
- The effect is drawn locally with runtime shaders; no new permissions or data use.

## 0.16.1-uno01

Maintenance release: identical app, built and published by the new automated CI release pipeline.

## 0.16.0-uno01

First Uno Launcher release, rebranded from jakesgoodapps/DuoLauncher.

- Add an optional personal news feed: RSS 2.0 and Atom pages fetched directly from the addresses you add, cached on the device, and shown in the Discover slot where Google's feed is unavailable or when you prefer it.
- Open the Discover slot on devices without Window Extensions support when feeds are configured, so the feed works without the Google app.
- Keep the feed private: the new internet permission is used only for fetching added feeds, nothing is uploaded, and removing a feed removes its cache.
- Rebrand the app, wallpapers, shade service, documentation, and user-facing text to Uno Launcher. The package identifier remains `com.jake.duolauncher`, inherited from the upstream project.

## 0.15.0-beta01

First public-beta preparation release. Tested scope and APK checksums accompany the release package.

- Add a skippable introduction for fresh installations and help through customization; existing layouts open directly.
- Improve recovery choices when Google Discover is unavailable.
- Show distinct Wi-Fi levels across the dot and three arcs.
- Preserve the current wallpaper when photo selection is canceled or fails, and improve interrupted preview recovery and temporary permission cleanup.
- Prepare optimized release builds, external signing, public-source export, and automated build checks.
- Add installation, update, permission, contribution, and compatibility documentation.

## 0.14.7

- Restore long-press pickup in scrollable Android widgets while preserving native vertical scrolling.

## 0.14.6

- Preserve the selected Home page or unfolded pair when returning from an app.

## 0.14.5

- Allow vertical scrolling inside native Android widgets.

## Earlier development

Home/All apps paging; right-side dock; overlapping unfolded pages and an unfolded-only workspace; native widgets and visual selection; cross-page dragging and temporary pages; work/personal profiles; Home folders; local wallpapers and daylight appearance; layout backup; Google search/Discover; long-press customization; and motion/recovery refinements.
